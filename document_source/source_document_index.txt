## description

This collection contains source data and processing code for the reduced,
corrected, and concatenated sets in this bundle's data collection. Most of
these source data are available elsewhere on the PDS; the remainder are
available in published scientific literature. They are copied in this bundle
in order to (1) provide a 'snapshot' of the source material for our processed
data, should those archives change; and (2) to facilitate bug hunting, data
verification, and functionality-adding software forks.

## files

----
- hfe_cleaner.py
Simple Python script to ingest source data and send them through reduction
pipeline defined by functions in hfe_utils.py and hfe_corrections.py. Running
'python hfe_cleaner.py' in this directory, given an appropriately configured
Python 3 environment, will generate a directory tree named 'data_local' that
reproduces all data in this bundle's primary data collection. Small
modifications to this script can be used to write data out to other filepaths.
Dependencies beyond the Python 3 standard library are: astropy, numpy, pandas.
The Anaconda distribution of Python is preferred.

- hfe_utils.py
Python utilities for working with AHFE data: file parsing, unit conversion,
range concatenation, etc.

- hfe_corrections.py
Per-file notes and corrections: outlier flags, bitflip magnitude definitions,
etc.
